I really, REALLY like coding — and I like to think my Economics degree often helps me weigh the marginal cost of that one extra slice of pizza.",
        "p2":"Like I said, I love coding. I have experience in mobile and web applications, creating APIs, and a few areas of AWS. One time, my team and I even worked with a little robot. Honestly though, I’m just hungry and excited to keep getting my hands dirty with new work.",
        "p3":"Take some time. Click around. Get to know me and my work, and let me know what you think. Please— I am just a poor enneagram 3 without enough to achieve.",
